    "Let $r_{i}$ denotes one of the N reads generated during sequencing, and let $l_{i}$ denotes the length of the read. So, $r_{i}$ [1], $r_{i}$ [$l_{i}$] would denote the base call at each position of the read. Subsequently, use $e_{i}[j]$ to denote the error rate at position j of the read $r_{i}$, and transition rates between the same pair of bases are assumed to be the same for any position from any read. Let $m_{i}$[1...$l_{i}$] denotes the aligned sequence's corresponding base for the read $r_{i}$. Then, assume there are M sequences to be mapped to, and let $a_{i}$[1...N] be the indicator of whether the read $r_{i}$ could align with a sequence (1 for yes, 0 for no). Thus, the probability of a read i being generated from a sequence j is P($r_{i}$ |$m_{i}$[j]==1) =  $\\prod_{i=1}^j$ P($r_{i}$|$e_{i}[j]$,transition,$m_{i}[j]$)"
